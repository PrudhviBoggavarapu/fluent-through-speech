## Why FluentThroughSpeech?

Speaking a new language is all about practice. But it can be intimidating to speak with native speakers, and it's hard to know if you're saying things correctly. FluentThroughSpeech solves this by providing a safe, private, and effective practice environment.

### ‚≠ê Key Features

- **Step-by-Step Lessons:** Follow guided lessons that take you from individual sentences to full paragraphs, building your skills progressively.
- **Instant Pronunciation Feedback:** After you speak, our AI analyzes your pronunciation and shows you exactly where you excelled and where you can improve with a simple, color-coded comparison.
- **100% Private & Secure:** All voice analysis happens directly on your computer. Your voice data **never** leaves your device, is never uploaded to a server, and is never stored. Your practice is completely private.
- **Track Your Progress:** See which lessons you've completed and watch your accuracy improve over time. All progress is saved locally in your browser.
- **No Installation Needed:** Just open the website and start speaking. It's that simple.

## üé§ How to Use

1.  **Visit the Website:** Once the live demo is available, simply open the link in a modern web browser like Chrome or Firefox.
2.  **Choose a Lesson:** Select a story or lesson from the list that matches your skill level.
3.  **Start Practicing:** Click the record button and read the sentence or paragraph aloud.
4.  **Get Instant Feedback:** See your transcribed text compared to the original and get an accuracy score.
5.  **Repeat!** The more you practice, the more fluent you'll become.
